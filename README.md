# express-api-docs

This is the repository for the Express API documentation and is published to
[expressjs.github.io/express-api-docs](http://expressjs.github.io/express-api-docs)
as a [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) website.

NOTE: This API documentation is also published, along with additional technical documentation at
[http://expressjs.com](http://expressjs.com).

## Local Setup

GitHub Pages websites being served through [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), you will need to replicate
the setup on your local machine to preview the website locally.  If you don't have them already, install:

- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)
- [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)

Once installed, `cd` to the repository directory and run Jekyll using the following command:

```
$ cd express-api-docs
$ jekyll s
```

Then, load [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/) on your browser.

Jekyll uses a variant of Markdown known as [Kramdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html).
Read up the docs if you need to go beyond basic Markdown in the doc files.

To understand the template system used by Jekyll, read the [Liquid template engine docs](http://liquidmarkup.org/).
